## 🎨 Data Specifications

### Language Distribution (1st Year Only)
As requested, only 1st year students have language columns with:
- **Hindi**: ~40% of students
- **Sanskrit**: ~30% of students
- **Tamil**: ~30% of students

### Student Data Quality
- **Realistic Names**: Indian names with variety (Aarav, Priya, Krishna, etc.)
- **Proper Register Numbers**: Format `YYCCCCSSSS` (Year-Course-Shift-Serial)
- **Age-Appropriate DOB**: Realistic birth dates for each year of study
- **Consistent Format**: Follows the same structure as your original sample

### Excel Structure
Each file contains:
1. **Academic Year Header**: "Academic Year: 2024-2025"
2. **Column Headers**: S.No, Register Number, Student Name, Department, Shift, [Language]
3. **Student Data**: Main row + Date of Birth row (following your format)

## ✅ Testing Results

All sample files have been tested and verified:

### API Import Test Results:
- ✅ **1st Year BCOM Shift I** (WITH language): 25 students imported successfully
- ✅ **2nd Year BCOM Shift I** (WITHOUT language): 22 students imported successfully  
- ✅ **1st Year BSC CS Shift I** (WITH language): 30 students imported successfully
- ✅ **3rd Year BSC CS Shift II** (WITHOUT language): 29 students imported successfully

### Verification Confirms:
- ✅ Files with language column work perfectly
- ✅ Files without language column work perfectly (Excel import fix working)
- ✅ All register numbers are unique
- ✅ All data formats are consistent
- ✅ Language values are properly distributed

## 🚀 Usage Scenarios

### For Language-Based Testing:
```
Use: sample_I_B.COM_Shift_I.xlsx, sample_I_BSC_CS_Shift_I.xlsx
Test: Schedule exam filtering by Hindi, Sanskrit, or Tamil
Expected: Only students with selected language appear in seating
```

### For Mixed Class Testing:
```
Use: sample_I_B.COM_Shift_I.xlsx + sample_II_B.COM_Shift_I.xlsx
Test: Schedule with one class having language, other without
Expected: Language filtering for 1st year, all students for 2nd year
```

### For Capacity Testing:
```
Use: sample_I_BSC_CS_Shift_I.xlsx (30 students)
Test: Room capacity management
Expected: Room splitting or capacity warnings
```

## 📋 Register Number Examples

- **1st Year BCOM Shift I**: `12230001001` to `12230001025`
