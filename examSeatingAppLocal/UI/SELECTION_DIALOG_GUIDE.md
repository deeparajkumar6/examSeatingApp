## Usage

### Basic Usage
```vue
<template>
  <!-- Class Selection -->
  <EnhancedClassSelector
    v-model="selectedClasses"
    :classes="availableClasses"
  />
  
  <!-- Room Selection -->
  <EnhancedRoomSelector
    v-model="selectedRooms"
    :exam-rooms="availableRooms"
    :total-students="totalStudents"
  />
  
  <!-- Capacity Analysis -->
  <CapacityAnalysis
    :selected-classes="selectedClassesData"
    :selected-rooms="selectedRoomsData"
    :total-students="totalStudents"
    :total-capacity="totalCapacity"
  />
</template>
```

### With Validation
```vue
<template>
  <EnhancedClassSelector
    ref="classSelector"
    v-model="selectedClasses"
    :classes="availableClasses"
    :required="true"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
const classSelector = ref(null)

const validateSelection = () => {
  return classSelector.value?.validate() ?? true
}
</script>
```

## Data Structure

### Class Object
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  className: string,
  shift: number | null,
  language: string | null, // Language of instruction (e.g., "Hindi", "English")
  students: Array<{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    // ... other student properties
  }>
}
```

### Display Format
Classes are displayed with the following format:
- **Without language**: `I B.COM -CS - Shift I`
- **With language**: `I B.COM -CS - Shift I - Language Hindi`
- **No shift, with language**: `I BCA - Language English`
- **No language specified**: `I B.SC Mathematics`

The language information is only displayed when available in the class data.

### Room Object
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  roomNumber: string,
  roomBuilding: string,
  roomFloor: number,
  roomCapacity: number
}
```

## Styling

The components use Vuetify's design system with:
- **Consistent color coding** for capacity indicators
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Smooth animations** for dialog transitions
- **Accessible design** with proper ARIA labels

## Demo

A demo component is available at `src/components/demo/SelectionDialogDemo.vue` that showcases:
- Mock data generation
- All selection features
- Capacity analysis
- Real-time updates

## Integration

The enhanced selectors are integrated into the main scheduler form (`ScheduleForm.vue`) and provide:
- **Backward compatibility** with existing data structures
- **Enhanced validation** with visual feedback
- **Improved user experience** with better organization
- **Real-time capacity analysis** for better decision making

## Benefits

1. **Improved Usability**: Dialog-based selection is more intuitive
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of selected vs. available items
3. **Enhanced Search**: Quick filtering reduces selection time
4. **Smart Recommendations**: Helps users make better capacity decisions
