## Changes Made

### Removed Components

1. **Debug Component (DataFlowDebug)**

## Current Form Structure

```vue
<template>
  <v-card-text>
    <v-form ref="form" v-model="valid">
      <!-- Date Selection -->
      <DatePicker v-model="formData.date" />
      
      <!-- Session Selection -->
      <SessionSelector v-model="formData.session" />
      
      <!-- Examination Title -->
      <v-text-field v-model="formData.title" />
      
      <!-- Class Selection -->
      <EnhancedClassSelector v-model="formData.classes" />
      
      <!-- Room Selection -->
      <EnhancedRoomSelector v-model="formData.exam_rooms" />
      
      <!-- Capacity Analysis -->
      <CapacityAnalysis 
        :selected-classes="selectedClassesData"
        :selected-rooms="selectedRoomsData"
        :total-students="totalStudents"
        :total-capacity="totalCapacity"
      />
      
      <!-- Options -->
      <ScheduleOptions v-model="formData.split" />
      
      <!-- Submit Button -->
      <v-btn @click="handleSubmit">Generate Schedule</v-btn>
    </v-form>
  </v-card-text>
</template>
```

## Functionality Preserved

✅ **Language Selection**: Still works through EnhancedClassSelector
✅ **Class Filtering**: Language-based filtering still functional
✅ **Capacity Analysis**: Room capacity validation still present
✅ **Form Validation**: All validation logic intact
✅ **API Integration**: Language selections still sent to backend

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Cleaner UI**: Removed debug information that was confusing users
2. **Simplified Interface**: Less visual clutter on the form
3. **Better UX**: Users can focus on essential form fields
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All core features still work
5. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Fewer components to load

## Testing Checklist
